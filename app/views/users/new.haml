            To be listed as author, you need a "handle".
            We may already have your name on the list.
            If you find yourself, you will be able to enter your own problems.
            Try typing your name here:

          = form.label :name, 'Name'
          = text_field_tag :name_handle, '', style: 'width:10em'

          %p.hideable#details(style = 'visibility:hide;margin:10px 0 200px')
            %p.hideable
              Handle:
              %span.hideable.x#handle
            %p.hideable
              Name:
              %span.hideable.x#name
        %h3.accord I am not listed, just register me as a user.
        %div
          I am not in the WFCC database, or am not willing to link
          this account to author at this time.  Just register me.
          
          = form.label :name, 'Name'
          = form.text_field :name #, style: 'width:20em'
